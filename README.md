## About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a portfolio site to showcase my projects/work in the fun concept of an OS. Instead of traditional portfolios whose projects redirect the user outside the site, this 'Portfolio OS' project allows users to see and interact with things as 'programs' right away.
